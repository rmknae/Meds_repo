## Purpose Of This Tutorial
This tutorial is written to help people understand some of the basics of shell script programming (aka shell scripting), and hopefully to introduce some of the possibilities of simple but powerful programming available under the Bourne shell. As such, it has been written as a basis for one-on-one or group tutorials and exercises, and as a reference for subsequent use.

**Let's get started!!!**

## üñ•Ô∏è  Shell Scripting:
A shell script is just a file/program that contains a list of commands you would normally type in the terminal. The script runs these commands automatically when you execute it, saving you time and effort.
### Example: 
Here‚Äôs a simple shell script:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!
```

**How to Run It:**
  1.  Create a file called hello.sh.
  2.  Add the script above to the file.
  3.  Open the terminal and type the following to make the script executable:

```
chmod +x hello.sh
```
  4. Now, run the script with:
```
./hello.sh
```
### Output
```
Hello, World!
```
That's it! A shell script is just a way to automate tasks by writing commands in a file and running them all at once.
